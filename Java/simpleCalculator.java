     * Sum A + B
     * A sum-based project is a great way to get started with Java programming.
     * The project is quite simple â€” the user will input two numbers (which are treated as the variables A and B),
     * and the program will add them together and present the sum of A + B. This can help you learn to work with methods and integers.
